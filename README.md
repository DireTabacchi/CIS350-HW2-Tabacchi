- I like to learn languages, and am currently learning Polish!
- I'm interested in learning about video game engines, and want to know more about their architecture!
- I'm interested in horology, the study of timekeeping (or watchmaking), and I would like to develop a skill of watch-repair!

### Technical Background
I have worked with Java during my Freshman year at Northern Michigan University, after which C/C++ was used for any other programming courses.
I have written a simple web-server in C/C++ to process simple HTTP requests.
I have some web-development experience, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I have built a simple voltmeter on a breadboard with an analog-to-digital converter chip (ADC0809) and an Arduino MEGA 2560, programmed in Assembly for the ATmega2560 8-bit microcontroller.
